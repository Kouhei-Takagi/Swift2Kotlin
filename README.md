# Swift2Kotlin
Swift2Kotlin is made for converting Swift code to Kotlin code.

Its function is still not perfect. 
I keep on improving it slowly.

“Format” Button is convert Swift code in left text field to Kotlin code in right one.
“Open .swift file” Button is for open your .swift file.
“Save as .txt” Button is for saving your Kotlin code in right field as text file.
The text file name will be “Date” & “Kotlin” & “.txt”.
